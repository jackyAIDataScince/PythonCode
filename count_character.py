#To count the occurrences of a character, we need to write an algorithm that returns the number of times
# each character appears in the input string. The algorithm must iterate through each character from the beginning #to count the number of times each character appears in the string.
# Hereâ€™s how to write an algorithm for counting character occurrences using Python:

def count_characters(s):
    count = [0]
    for i in s:
        if i in count:
           count[i] += 1
        else:
           count[i] = 1

print(count_characters("Thecleverprogrammer"))
